Exploring the relative distances from Earth of stars in constellations.  Starting with Orion.

python3 build_orion.py, config values controlled in the file for now.

Need to create a pip freeze so others can play, but for now, external requirements are 
- numpy
- bokeh

I use view3dscene for running VRML scenes:
